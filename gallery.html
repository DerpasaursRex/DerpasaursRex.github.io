      <h2>Meme Project</h2>
      <h5>Goofy, September 1,2020</h5>
     <img class="img-fluid" src="MacDonald_Assignment_2.jpg" width="500" height="333">
      
      
      <p>One of my first art projects for my art-74 class. We had to take random photos and combine them together into one piece or meme. My favorite types of memes are the ones that make no sense and that are distorted beyond belief. That's why I made this, to make a funny deep fried meme based off my sense of humor.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Mouse Bodypillow</h2>
      <h5>It's a joke I swear, September 13,2020</h5>
     <img class="img-fluid" src="JimmyFull.png" width="500" height="333">
      
      
      <p>A character created as a joke in a Discord server that I'm in has now spiraled into a character I draw a lot of. I love the colors I picked, which I found online, and her oufit is made up of my favorite elements of character design. Clothes that show a bit of skin, fingerless gloves, and thigh highs are all things I love to draw. Anyway, I drew her on a bodypillow to get a reaction out of my friends and it was worth it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Glitch Project</h2>
      <h5>Twofy, September 15,2020</h5>
     <img class="img-fluid" src="MacDonald_Assignment_3.jpg" width="500" height="333">
     
      <p>Another art-74 project, where we had to put photos in Audacity and garble it up. So I made my cursed meme even more cursed by distorting the image even more. It was really fun and I think it made my image even better.</p>
      <br>
       <h2>Glitch Project 2.0</h2>
      <h5>The Revenge, September 15,2020</h5>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="PBoytherevenge.png" width="300" height="333">
      
      <p>The second image I glitchified. A mash-up of emoji parts into another joke character me and a friend came up with. The outcome was a lot cooler then the previous one, as it gave the character and intresting gradient and a background. However, I can not tell you what effects I used to reach this final image, sadly. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>3D Remix</h2>
      <h5>Fictional goddess statue, September 29,2020</h5>
     <img class="img-fluid" src="MacDonald_Screenshot.PNG" width="500" height="333">
      
      
      <p>A mash-up of various 3D objects I found on Thingverse that I put together and then rendered. The object is meant to look like a sculpture of a goddess that could be found in an art museum. Even though it is not as good as a professional sculpture, I still managed to make the transition of objects look pretty seamless. Especially the body, which was two separate pieces I had to smooth together to look like one cohesive piece. Also, we had to write a story describing your object and I created a pretty intricate story that took on a life of it's own.
