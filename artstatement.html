      <p> I haven’t always liked to draw, I’d like to create stories and ideas yet I didn’t really start my art journey until middle school. My friends at the time were artists and I still remember how I thought their art was some of the greatest I’ve ever seen. So I basically stared art because I wanted to fit in with my friends at the time, but I’ve also done art classes as a child. So it wasn’t all because of peer pressure, anyway I now draw all the time. It helps me express my ideas visually without having to explain certain details even I can’t really make out. Art is what I love, I can’t really imagine life without doing some sort of art. Character Illustrations are my favorite to do, like I said I like to write as well and drawing the characters in my stories help me to visualize their character better. Also I can make them almost easily with a mouse, as it is what I mainly use to make art digitally.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even though a lot of my portfolio has mainly digital art, traditional is what a do more of and what I’m the most comfortable with. Sketching crazy creatures and cute characters fills up the majority of my sketchbooks. Anything in my brain ends up on a page, even if it is on homework. I used to not use many outlines when I drew, I would just go straight into it then I thankfully grew out of that. My outlines and sketches still need work, but the get the job done at the end. I use very round shapes when making my art meaning mostly circles and curves. So my characters usually end up with a round head and eyes, yet I’m trying to experiment with jaws. However, if I try to put a jaw on a human character it does not look good.
        <br>
        <br>
            Anyways, my style ranges from cutesy to horror as I love to draw cute girls and boys, but I also love to draw monsters and the occasional body horror. Probably stems from me watch cartoons and horror movies. I love both mediums so I draw those two the most, sometimes I combine both by having a cute character covered in blood. Another type I lean towards is comedy, I love making people laugh and I tend to make joke art to do just that. In fact, a few characters in my portfolio are joke characters I created with friends. Expressing all the ideas I have into some sort of piece is pretty much why I create. My brain is constantly thinking, so when I can’t express them in words I do so through art as a way to cool off. Art helps me cope and I want to share it with others to hopefully help them cope as well. Creativity and entertainment is, in my opinion, the best form of expression when it comes expressing one’s self. And I don’t think I’ll ever stop trying to give my best in art.
